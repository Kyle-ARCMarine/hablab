7. USER FEEDBACK

The User may voluntarily provide feedback, suggestions, ideas, or bug reports to ARC Marine Ltd. regarding the Software (“Feedback”).

8. NO WARRANTY; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

Disclaimer of Warranty: The Software is provided “AS IS”, without warranty of any kind. ARC Marine Ltd. and its affiliates expressly disclaim all warranties and conditions, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, satisfactory quality, accuracy, and non-infringement.

(or its directors, officers, employees, or agents) be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages of any kind, or for any loss of profits, loss of data, business interruption, or loss of goodwill, arising out of or related to the use of or inability to use the Software, even if ARC Marine Ltd. has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no case shall ARC Marine’s aggregate liability under this Agreement, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, exceed £0 (zero pounds sterling).

Consumer Rights: Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation of liability for certain types of damages. Nothing in this Section 8 is intended to exclude or limit any condition, warranty, right or liability which may not be lawfully excluded or limited. In such jurisdictions, the exclusions and limitations above shall apply to the greatest extent permitted by law.

9. ATTRIBUTION AND NON-ENDORSEMENT

The User agrees to acknowledge the use of the Hablab Software (ARC Marine Ltd.) in any academic publication, thesis, or conference presentation that incorporates results obtained with the Software. Any such attribution should follow standard scholarly practice (e.g., citation in a methods section or footnote acknowledging “Hablab software by ARC Marine Ltd. was used for analysis”). This attribution requirement helps inform the community and credits ARC Marine’s contribution.

However, the User may not use the name “ARC Marine Ltd.”, “Hablab”, or any associated logos or trademarks to endorse or promote any product, service, or entity without prior written permission from ARC Marine Ltd. Aside from the factual academic attribution described above, nothing in this Agreement grants the User any rights to ARC Marine’s names or branding for marketing or publicity purposes.

10. TERMINATION

This Agreement and the license granted herein are effective from the moment the User accepts the terms (by downloading or using the Software) and shall remain in effect until terminated. The User may terminate this Agreement at any time by ceasing all use of the Software and destroying all copies in their possession.

ARC Marine Ltd. may terminate this Agreement (and the User’s license) immediately without prior notice if the User breaches any provision of this Agreement. Upon any termination of this Agreement, the User must immediately discontinue all use of the Software, delete or destroy any copies of the Software (and any components or data derived from it) in the User’s possession or control, and certify compliance with this destruction obligation upon request.

Termination of this Agreement will not limit any of ARC Marine Ltd.’s rights or remedies at law or in equity for prior breaches by the User. Sections relating to Ownership (Section 4), Restrictions (Section 6), Feedback (Section 7), No Warranty and Liability (Section 8), Attribution/Non-endorsement (Section 9), Governing Law (Section 11), and Miscellaneous (Section 12) shall survive termination of this Agreement, as well as any provisions which by their nature are intended to survive.

11. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, without regard to its conflict of law principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.

The parties agree that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Software. The User consents to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ARC Marine Ltd. shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent or stop a breach of this Agreement by the User.

12. MISCELLANEOUS

Severability: If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith a valid, enforceable substitute provision that most nearly effects the parties’ original intent.

Entire Agreement: This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding and agreement between the User and ARC Marine Ltd. with respect to the Software and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and representations relating to the Software or its use. The User confirms that in entering into this Agreement, it has not relied on any statement or representation not expressly set out herein.

No Waiver: The failure of ARC Marine Ltd. to enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of that or any other provision. A waiver is only effective if in writing and signed by an authorized representative of ARC Marine Ltd.

No Assignment: The User may not assign or transfer this Agreement (or any rights or obligations hereunder) to any third party without the prior written consent of ARC Marine Ltd. Any attempted assignment in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.
